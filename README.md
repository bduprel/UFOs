# UFOs

## Overview
This project was done to help Dana create an even better table filter so users could more specifically search for articles of interest. 

## Results
After completion of this project, the user will be able to filter data to better search what they are looking for. 

An example of this is if they want to only look for sightings of a certain shape of UFO. If they are interested in triangle shaped UFOs, they can enter triangle in the shape filter to limit the results to those that match.

The code is able to filter the data based on the id chosen to filter by. It pulls this from the data.js file and combs through the identifiers that was selected by the user. 

## Summary 
The biggest setback for this site would be the overall limit of data. Besides this issue, the user also does not know what choices are available. If they enter a city or shape that is not in the dataset, the table returns blank. 
The interface is actually rather user friendly. But if I were to work toward improving it, I would look to expand the dataset overall and I would recommend adding a dropdown tool that would be alphabetized to go along with the search tool so users who may just be curious do not have to have a certain level of knowledge about the data prior to using it.
